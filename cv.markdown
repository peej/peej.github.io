    <dt><a href="http://essocard.com">EssoCard</a></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Tribal London worked in partnership with A&EDDB London to build and deliver the new consumer facing web site for the Exxon EssoCard payment card across 9 markets in Europe. The site was designed and built from the ground up as an adaptive HTML build to scale the site and functionality from desktop to mobile touch devices.</p>
        <p>I was technical lead and responsble for data capture functionality, content management and multi-lingual support for 11 locales, HTML build, and SalesForce integration.</p>

    <dt><a href="http://marmite-gold.fbincludes.com">Marmite Oxford Street Christmas Lights</a></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>For Christmas 2012 we promoted Marmite by sponsoring the Oxford Street Christmas Lights,
        as a part of this Tribal installed a 2.4m LED screen into one of the lights surrounded
        by a santa hat and beard onto which the public could place their face to be part of the
        lights.</p>
        <img src="gfx/oxford-street.jpg">
        <p>I designed and built the system for capturing users photos and pushing them to the
        screen and capturing an image of the Oxford Street scene from cameras mounted on the street.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="http://awards2.digivault.co.uk/?p=710">Monopoly City Streets</a></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>During the buildup to Christmas 2009, we developed an online game for Hasbro to promote
        a new version of the Monopoly board game. We created an online massively multiplayer game
        of Monopoly played upon a Google Maps mashup, allowing players to buy any street in the
        World and earn rent and build buildings upon them.</p>
        <img src="gfx/monopoly-city-streets.jpg">
        <p>The project involved a complex Javascript application and a highly scalable PHP/MySQL/MemcacheD
        backend that was stretched to over 200 Web servers and 14 database servers so as to handle
        the 1.4 million active players.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="http://www.guinness.com/">Guinness.com</a></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Tribal designed and built a new global Guinness.com website for the famous beer brand
        and migrated it away from a Microsoft Sharepoint Server setup to a LAMP stack.</p>
        <p>I was responsible for designing a site architecture that would allow individual local
        territories to update and manage their own sections of the site without effecting other territories
        work while still allowing for global site-wide updates. Separate SVN repositories for each locale
        and careful segmenting of the codebase was designed to allow development, testing and deployment
        of each of the 14 locales in isolation while still making sure that the whole site worked
        together as a whole.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/">Volkswagen UK</a></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>In 2007 we rebuilt the Volkswagen UK site from scratch. I was technical lead on the
        project, responsible for application architecture and integration, and HTML frontend
        lead in charge of the HTML/CSS/Javascript build. This involved managing a team of 7
        developers and working with the Flex and and project management team leads. The project
        was built using a Java/Spring/Hibernate/MySQL/JBoss combination for the backend, a
        large Flex/Flash component and HTML/CSS/Javascript on the frontend, we also designed,
        built and hosted a fully redundant virtual server setup for the final deployment. The project was
        delivered early 2008.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Marmite.com</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>We designed and built the new look Marmite Web site, using the distinctive love/hate
        theme to create a dual personality site. I was responsible for defining and building HTML page
        templates and CSS that would translate the graphically intense and visually impacting design
        into a standards compilant and accessible Web site.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Monopoly Live</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>We developed an online game for Hasbro in collaboration with DDB London. We placed GPRS
        enabled GPS devices in 18 London cabs and tracked their movement around the city, turning the
        capital into a real life game of Monopoly. We used PHP and MySQL exclusively for storing and
        processing over 190,000 users data in real time. I worked mainly on the SMS integration and
        the initial HTML/CSS build.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Guardian Jobs: People Profiler</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>In March of 2006 we developed a Web based personality profiler for a Guardian Jobs
        promotion. I designed the PHP/MySQL backend that collected the user data and processed it
        overnight to generate the statistics the site is based around. I was also responsible for
        developing the sites information architecture and building the HTML/CSS.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>VW Golf Night Driving</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>As part of an integrated television and online campaign for the new Volkswagen
        Golf, I designed and built this Google Maps mashup allowing users to view and
        create driving routes. It uses a PHP/MySQL backend and a Javascript/Ajax frontend.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>LiveSimplicity</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>We created a bespoke community forum system for Philips to promote
        discussion around their corporate positioning of simplicity in product design.
        I designed and built an MVC based PHP/Smarty/MySQL application framework to
        build the site upon and worked along side a HTML/CSS developer to produce
        an accessible and modern community site.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>TribalDDB Ticket System</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>I designed and built a Web and e-mail based ticket system for internal use by the TribalDDB
        Volkswagen team. The system allows the management team, developers and the client keep track of
        outstanding work and it's progress from a single Web based interface.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Austravel</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>I spec'd, developed and built a CMS system and Web site for antipodean specialist travel
        agent Austravel. The project involved HTML/CSS build, development of a Web based content
        management system, user training, and support and maintenance.</p>
