    <div class="note">
        <p>I have been designing and developing Web pages since early 1998, I am a self-taught Web designer and programmer relying heavily on information from the many sources of the Internet and the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>I believe heavily in developing Web applications using the <acronym title="Keep it Simple, Stupid">KISS</acronym> principles of "less is more" and am a proponent of the <a href="/articles/rest.html">REST architectural style</a>.</p>
